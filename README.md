This page is about Binomial distributions and comprises four sections:



# Comparing two binomials

 1. Set the desired values for n (number of events) and p (probability of success on a single event) using the sliders
2. See the distribution of k (number of successes) for each of the rules in the first graph, as well as the cumulated probability in the second graph, and for each of the rules.
3. Tooltips give precise values
4. You can also set your display to bubbles or bars.




# Understanding p

 1. Hit the question mark on any of the p lines
 2. Pick a rule from the menu to define success and see associated probability (for example, 6 wins has a probability of 1/6 – we’re assuming here the dice are not loaded.
 3. Throw the dice as many times as you like




# Understanding n and k

 1. Hit any of the question marks on the n lines
 2. Using the same probability, the dice is now cast n times. K is the number of wins (successes) that are recorded.
 3. Again, play as many games as you like and see how k varies

# Playing the game again and again
----------------------------------------
 1. Like in the previous section, we’re throwing the dice again and again.
 2. n throws make game 1, with a number of successes equal to k(1)
 3. another n throws make game 2, with a number of successes equal to k(2)
 4. and so on…
 5. The graph shows how the k(i) are distributed, compared to the distribution.
 6. Hit the Fast Forward button and play 100 games at once
 7. See how, gradually, our winning hands average out to the Binomial distribution.
