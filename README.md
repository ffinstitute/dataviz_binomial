This page is about Binomial distributions and comprises four sections:



# Comparing two binomials
------------------------------
 * Set the desired values for n (number of events) and p (probability of success on a single event) using the sliders
 * See the distribution of k (number of successes) for each of the rules in the first graph, as well as the cumulated probability in the second graph, and for each of the rules.
 * Tooltips give precise values
 * You can also set your display to bubbles or bars.




# Understanding p
------------------------------
 * Hit the question mark on any of the p lines
 * Pick a rule from the menu to define success and see associated probability (for example, 6 wins has a probability of 1/6 – we’re assuming here the dice are not loaded.
 * Throw the dice as many times as you like




# Understanding n and k
-------------------------------
 * Hit any of the question marks on the n lines
 * Using the same probability, the dice is now cast n times. K is the number of wins (successes) that are recorded.
 * Again, play as many games as you like and see how k varies

# Playing the game again and again
----------------------------------------
 * Like in the previous section, we’re throwing the dice again and again.
 * n throws make game 1, with a number of successes equal to k(1)
 * another n throws make game 2, with a number of successes equal to k(2)
 * and so on…
 * The graph shows how the k(i) are distributed, compared to the distribution.
 * Hit the Fast Forward button and play 100 games at once
 * See how, gradually, our winning hands average out to the Binomial distribution.
